## VERDANT VISION: AN INTELLIGENT GARDENING ECOSYSTEM USING AI

---

**Verdant Vision** is a pioneering intelligent gardening system that leverages **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and the **Internet of Things (IoT)** to provide data-driven, precise, and sustainable plant care. It transforms traditional gardening into a self-sustaining, proactive solution that dynamically optimizes plant health and minimizes environmental impact.

### üåü Features and Highlights

* **AI-Driven Precision Irrigation:** Uses advanced **Machine Learning algorithms** (specifically a Random Forest Classifier, which achieved **100% accuracy** in prediction) to model plant behavior and determine the precise, optimal watering timing based on real-time environmental data.
* **Real-Time Environmental Monitoring:** Integrates **soil moisture, temperature, and humidity sensors** to continuously monitor the garden environment.
* **Automated Resource Optimization:** AI-driven analytics optimize watering and fertilization, enabling **adaptive adjustments** to environmental conditions. This automation eliminates water waste and maintains ideal soil health.
* **Proven Efficiency:** Early results demonstrate a **30% improvement in water efficiency** and a notable increase in plant vitality and resource application.
* **Remote Management:** Data is sent to a cloud server (using **Blynk**) for remote access, allowing users to manage and monitor their gardens through a mobile application.
* **Scalability:** The system is designed to be scalable for applications ranging from small **home gardens** to **commercial agricultural operations**.

### üí° Problem Solved

Traditional and existing gardening systems are often manual, resource-inefficient, and time-intensive. Key issues addressed include:

* **Water Waste:** Over **50% of garden water is often lost** due to inefficient irrigation methods.
* **Inconsistent Plant Health:** Gardeners often rely on guesswork to monitor soil conditions, leading to inconsistent plant health and a higher risk of disease or pest outbreaks.
* **Climate Fluctuation:** The system provides resilience against changing climate patterns, which can otherwise lead to decreased yield and compromised plant health.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

The system is built on an **AIoT (Artificial Intelligence of Things)** framework, combining hardware and software components.
